# Differences from Ariadne II

## Simpler Stack and Return Stack

The Stack and Return Stack are represented with Python 3 `list`s.

## Pretty Printing of Items on the Stack

Longer representations of items on the Stack are shown as `*`.
"Long" is relative to the width of the console.
A long representation is approximately half the width of the console or longer.
